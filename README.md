This repository contains my solutions to problems that were included either in the [LeetCode Courses](https://leetcode.com/explore/) (also called Explore Cards) that I have taken or in the [LeetCode Problemset](https://leetcode.com/problemset/).

I am using the [LeetSync - LeetCode to GitHub Synchronizer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ppkbejeolfcbaomanmbpjdbkfcjfhjnd) Google Chrome extension to sync my problem submissions with this repository.

At the moment I am doing the [Course Layers](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/the-leetcode-beginners-guide/679/sql-syntax/4358/):
  1. **First and Second Layers:** Arrays 101, Linked List, Array and String, Hash Table, Recursion, Queue & Stack, Heap, and Binary Search
  2. **Second and Third Layers:** Recursion, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Trie, N-ary Tree, and Recursion II
  3. **Third and Fourth Layers:** Recursion II, Dynamic Programming, and Graph
